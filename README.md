# Yuv Color Distance Viewer
A simple website that shows the YUV color space at a Euclidean distance from a point. The website is available [here](ruivop.github.io/yuvColorDistanceViewer/).

This was done as an experiment to try to understand what were the expected matching colors if we tried to match the color at a Euclidean distance from a point in the yuv color space.
You may try the [CIELAB color space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELAB_color_space).
